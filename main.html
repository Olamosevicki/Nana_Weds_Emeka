        <h1 id="our_story">how we met</h1>
        
        <p>   
          I had just come out of a bad relationship and was done.I had <br>
        told my sisters "For the next one year, I just want to focus<br>
        on my self and my relationship with God.<br> 
          No guy should come and tell me anything, or ask for my number,<br>
        they shouldn't even tell me hi, everyone should just face their<br>
        front please".<br>
          Then on the last day of Yashab 2.1( @ The Grace Trybe) this  <br>
        handsome dark skinned guy did a ministration.The moment he<br> 
        opened his mouth to sing, I was hooked.In my mind I said<br>
        " God see this hot chocolate, I want " it was just a silly <br>
        thought because I had never seen or noticed him before. I <br>
        didn't even know we attended the same branch and I wasn't <br>
        expecting to see him after that day. <br>
          At the end of the program a friend introduced my <br>
        sisters and me to him, we said hi, and the next moment,he was<br> 
        off, and that was that. <br>
          Imagine my shock when I walked into church some Saturdays<br> 
        later ( <i>for workers prep service</i> ) and noticed him looking <br>
        right at me. There were at least 50 people there, so I just<br>
        brushed it off that he must have been looking at someone else.<br>
         But this went on for weeks, I'll feel someone starring at me,<br> 
        and he'll be the one. So one day, I decided to put it to test.<br> 
          When I noticed him staring, I smiled AND HE SMILED BACK!!<br> 
        Lol I almost had an heart attack that day. After the service,<br>
        he came over and said hi and that was that.<br> 
          Coincidentally, he was in the Tag team department but before<br>
        I joined he switched to the choir, but he was still on the Tag <br>
        team's WhatsApp group. That's how this man droped a comment on  <br>
        the group chat that I should DM him, we had alot to do together.  <br>
        I, thinking he was talking about business, did.That conversation  <br>
        lasted for days. We talked and talked for hours. We had alot in  <br>
        common but at the same time had alot to learn from each other.  <br>
        We spent all the time glued to our phones in steady conversation. <br> 
          At the end of two months, it was clear that I was intensely  <br>
        attracted to him. But he wasn't giving any signals so I tried <br>
        to clear that thought from my head. ( <i>Tried and failed</i> ) <br>
          After some time, he told me he  wanted a serious relationship  <br>
        with me. When I read that message, I dropped my phone and cried <br>
        a little. Like what are the odds? I remembered the silly little <br>
        prayer at Yashab and I just felt so loved by God. <br>
          God reminded me that he is interested in even the littlest of  <br>
        things that concern us. After some minutes, I cleaned my eyes, <br>
        picked up my phone and proceeded to do my "Shakara" lol. How  <br>
        else is a girl supposed to know that a guy was serious? Plus <br>
        I needed time to be sure I had healed and moved on from my  <br>
        previous relationship. <br>
          From the moment I decided to DM him, I found a best friend, <br>
        a lover, a partner, a supporter, a prayer partner. I have  <br>
        never had a reason to doubt or second guess my decision. <br>
          I am so excited and so grateful to God that I get to  <br>
        spend the rest of my life with my best friend. My Hot Chocolate. <br>

           It's indeed love at first worship because I'd never forget that  <br>
        day at YASHAB when I first saw these three sisters and knew that  <br>
        one of them was going to be mine. <br>
           I'll never forget one Saturday before choir rehearsals started <br> 
        I was in the church auditorium, and I prayed and told God the  <br>
        specifications I wanted in a lady. God sent Naomi who had all  <br>
        that, and even more.  <br>
           I'll never forget those beautiful nights where we'll talk on  <br>
        the phone for hours on end and could never have enough of each other. <br>
        I had to dig out my baby's number from Tag Team's group chat. I did <br>
        my observation, calculated all the calculatables and well,  <br>
        shot my shot and the rest they say, is history. <br>
           Imagine this girl keeping me hanging for six good months and  <br>
        then eventually agreeing to date me on my birthday in 2021. <br>
           Amazingly I waited. I have never waited that long for any lady <br>
        in my life. This is how I knew that I really love Naomi my homie. <br>
            Ours is a story of love, patience, trust, learning, unlearning, <br>
        faith, and a testament to God's faithfulness. <br>
            I bless the day I met you Naomi, and I know that our story will  <br>
        be one of the best love stories ever told. <br>
